| This file was made to list every file made for PepperTux and who made it. If a file isn't listed, it's probably from SuperTux    |
| or it only uses images from SuperTux (Spritesheets, for example)                                                                 |
| This file also copies the original SuperTux AUTHORS file.                                                                        |
| The things that were made for SuperTux but aren't actually in SuperTux will be listed here, as well as things that was not made  |
| for SuperTux but was used in SuperTux, like Chipdisko or Airship Remix.                                                          |
| Tilesets are not listed here because they're basically just code. The credits for the levels are in the levels and show in-game. |
