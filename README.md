# HaxeTux Old
Old version of a recreation of SuperTux 0.0.6 using HaxeFlixel. If the license is wrong, please let me know! (I don't know whether I'm supposed to use GPL V2 or GPL V3 for this)

If you want to see the new one, there should be a HaxeTux-New repository soon with stuff in it coming later. The reason why I've decided to do this is because the code is getting too "overwhelming" (it's terrible, ESPECIALLY playstate.hx) and I can't seem to finish making a power-up thing because I'm kind of dumb.

## Things that won't be recreated here
* Lives
* Saving
* All the text and stuff on screen (Although there will still be something to count the coins you have or whatever it is)
* Score?
* The exact same brick breaking effect of the original SuperTux 0.0.6
* Main Menu (There'll just be a basic main menu with options to view the credits and play the game)

## Credits
* Vaesea - The recreation
* Everyone who worked on SuperTux 0.0.0 to 0.0.6 - All the assets from SuperTux 0.0.6 that were used for this recreation.
* Lukas Nystrand (Mortimer Twang) - Mortimer's Chipdisko
* Larry Ewing - Creator of Tux

## More Info
I don't know who made salcon, the credits in SuperTux 0.0.6 doesn't say who made it I think.

## How To Compile
* Make sure you have the latest version of Haxe (4.3.7) installed.
* Make sure you have the latest version of HaxeFlixel and Flixel-Addons installed.
* Make sure you have the latest version of Lime installed.
* I think you also need the latest version of hxcpp? I'm not sure.
* I also think you need the latest version of openfl? I'm not sure.
* Go to the folder where the game's Project.xml is in a terminal and type "lime test windows -debug" if you're on Windows, "lime test mac -debug" if you're on Mac or "lime test linux -debug" if you're on Linux.

## Why does this exist?
I don't really know, but at least you'll be able to (sort of) play SuperTux 0.0.6 on Windows or Mac without using a virtual machine. I mean, it's not really the same since there's not gonna be a level editor and it'll obviously be slightly different than the real SuperTux 0.0.6.
