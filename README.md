# PepperTux
SuperTux fangame made using HaxeFlixel.

## Story
The same story as SuperTux, basically, Tux goes to a picnic with Penny, but Nolok attacks the two penguins and captures Penny, leaving just a note telling Tux that he doesn't stand a chance at getting Penny back, so Tux goes forward.

## How do I compile?
Install Haxe 4.3.7, then install HaxeFlixel, including Flixel-Addons. Then compile using "lime test (Your OS) -debug"

## How do I make levels?
Same way you make levels for HaxeTux.
