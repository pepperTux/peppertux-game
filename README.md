# PepperTux
SuperTux fangame made using HaxeFlixel. This is the old version that may be made alongside (if a certain poll is 50% on each side) or after the new version (if the poll is 50% on the side of 0.3.3 to 0.5.1)

## Info
To see the newest version of PepperTux, go to https://github.com/pepperTux/peppertux-godot as that's the newest version. It's just this game but made in Godot.

This is the poll mentioned in the first part of this readme: https://gamejolt.com/p/should-peppertux-be-more-like-supertux-milestone-1-or-should-it-be-rmptcazp

## Story
The same story as SuperTux, basically, Tux goes to a picnic with Penny, but Nolok attacks the two penguins and captures Penny, leaving just a note telling Tux that he doesn't stand a chance at getting Penny back, so Tux goes forward towards Nolok's castle.

## How do I compile?
Install Haxe 4.3.7, then install HaxeFlixel, including Flixel-Addons. Then compile using "lime test (Your OS) -debug"

## How do I make levels?
Same way you make levels for HaxeTux.
