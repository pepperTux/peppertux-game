# PepperTux
SuperTux fangame made using HaxeFlixel.

## Info
This version was discontinued for a while, but was continued due to the Godot version not going so well.

Also if anyone wants to help with levels, that would be appreciated.

## Story
The same story as SuperTux, basically, Tux goes to a picnic with Penny, but Nolok attacks the two penguins and captures Penny, leaving just a note telling Tux that he doesn't stand a chance at getting Penny back, so Tux goes forward towards Nolok's castle.

## How do I compile?
Install Haxe 4.3.7, then install HaxeFlixel, including Flixel-Addons. Then you need to install hxcpp (haxelib install hxcpp), then compile using "lime test (Your OS) -debug".
