# HaxeTux New
Recreation of SuperTux 0.0.6 using HaxeFlixel. If the license is wrong, please let me know! (I don't know whether I'm supposed to use GPL V2 or GPL V3 for this)

## Things that won't be recreated here
* Saving
* All the text and stuff on screen (Although there will still be some stuff from there, they wont be in the same positions or font)
* The exact same brick breaking effect of the original SuperTux 0.0.6
* Main Menu (There'll just be a basic main menu with options to view the credits and play the game)

## Credits
* Vaesea - The recreation
* Everyone who worked on SuperTux 0.0.0 to 0.0.6 - All the assets from SuperTux 0.0.6 that were used for this recreation.
* Lukas Nystrand (Mortimer Twang) - Mortimer's Chipdisko
* Larry Ewing - Creator of Tux
* Discover HaxeFlixel (Book) + Scribd - This recreation's code will likely look like the code in that book quite a lot.

## More Info
I don't know who made salcon, the credits in SuperTux 0.0.6 doesn't say who made it I think.

## How To Compile
* Make sure you have the latest version of Haxe (4.3.7) installed.
* Make sure you have the latest version of HaxeFlixel and Flixel-Addons installed.
* Make sure you have the latest version of Lime installed.
* I think you also need the latest version of hxcpp? I'm not sure.
* I also think you need the latest version of openfl? I'm not sure.
* Go to the folder where the game's Project.xml is in a terminal and type "lime test windows -debug" if you're on Windows, "lime test mac -debug" if you're on Mac or "lime test linux -debug" if you're on Linux.

## Why does this exist?
I don't really know, but at least you'll be able to (sort of) play SuperTux 0.0.6 on Windows or Mac without using a virtual machine. I mean, it's not really the same since there's not gonna be a level editor and it'll obviously be slightly different than the real SuperTux 0.0.6.
