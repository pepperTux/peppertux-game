MILESTONE 1:
"welcome_peppertux" = Welcome To PepperTux. It's a level that introduces you to the basic stuff, but is also sure you already know it by now.
"beginning_journey" = Beginning The Journey. It's a level that introduces you to Spikys and Secret Areas with a really easy-to-find secret area that even a Snowball finds!
"snowball_path" = Snowball Path. It's a level that introduces you to Bouncing Snowballs and is a remake of the first ever SuperTux level. The original level was made by Bill Kendrick and the remake was made by Sophie "Vaesea" Ball.
"platforms_icy_river" = Platforms In The Icy River. It's a level that introduces you to the fact that Tux can't swim. It was not made by Vaesea and was in fact made by AnatolyStev. The level is pretty hard to beat, so it's sort of like a miniboss as a level!
"bombs_ice" - Bombs On Ice. It's a level that introduces you to Mr Bombs, but you can also see and walk on bridges made out of wood.
